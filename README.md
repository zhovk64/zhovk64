# ✝️ *God Bless You, Visitor!*

> **"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."**  
> — *John 1:1*

I humbly write code in the **name of Christ**, forging software with discipline, clarity, and ascetic devotion.  
I believe that the act of creation through code can be a reflection of the divine Logos—the order and reason behind all things.

Every line I write is a small offering.  
Every program a prayer.  
Every compiler warning, a chance for humility.

*Languages and tools that shape my monastery of code:*

[![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))  
A language close to the machine, like a monk close to the silence of the desert.

[![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white)](https://isocpp.org/)  
Structured yet expressive — like Byzantine iconography in code.

[![CMake](https://img.shields.io/badge/CMake-064F8C?style=for-the-badge&logo=cmake&logoColor=white)](https://cmake.org/)  
Because order and structure are sacred.

[![Clang](https://img.shields.io/badge/Clang-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=llvm&logoColor=white)](https://clang.llvm.org/)  
Like a sharp patristic argument — uncompromising and precise.

[![Neovim](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neovim-57A143?style=for-the-badge&logo=neovim&logoColor=white)](https://neovim.io/)  
The desert father of editors — minimal, extensible, and ascetic.

[![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)](https://www.kernel.org/)  
My monastery's OS — open, humble, and powerful.

## 🕊️ Philosophy

> ⚡ **“I code in the name of the Lord, not for pride, but for purpose.”**

I reject the vanity of trends and the chaos of complexity for its own sake.  
Instead, I choose the **narrow path** — purity in structure, clarity in logic, humility before the machine and the Divine.

My goals:

- ✝️ Develop open-source tools for good.
- 🔒 Respect privacy and dignity of all users.
- 📜 Write code that is readable, maintainable, and just.
- ⛪ Contribute to software that respects time, attention, and spiritual life.
